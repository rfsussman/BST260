    "text": "Downloading course materials using Git\nYou can download the quarto files used to create the course notes using Git. You can update files using git pull but you will not be able to change the course notes on the main repository. This means that if you edit the files and then try to update then using git pull you will encounter conflicts. For this reason recommend that you make a copy before editing files. We have edited the .gitignore file so that if you add the word notes to your filenames, git will not track the files. So we recommend that you before editing you make a copy of the file and notes to the filename. For example 01-unix.qmd to 01-unix-notes.qmd.\nYou can download the files using git clone like this:\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to the directory you want to keep these notes in.\nType git clone  https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2023.git\n\nor using RStudio like this:\n\nGot to https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2023\nClick on the green “Clone or Download” on Github and copy the link.\nOpen RStudio, and go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and paste in the link you just copied. Under “Create Project as Sub-directory of”, browse and select a folder where you want the course materials to go.\nPress “Create Project”. This will create a folder called 2023 in the folder you selected in step 3.\nNow, you can open this project using the projects tab in the upper right of RStudio, or going to File &gt; Open Project and then navigating to the 2023 folder and opening the .Rproj file.\n\nOnce you cloned the course repository and want to get updates, you must use git pull to get updates. You can do this in the terminal or on the RStudion Git pane.\n\nAssociating an existing directory\nIf you already cloned the repository outside of RStudio, you can associate the directory that was created in that step with RStudio. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory, and then navigate / click on the 2023 folder. Then click “Create Project”. Then you can follow step 5 above to open the project when you launch RStudio.\n\n\nForking the repository\nAn alternative more advanced way to cloning the directory is creating a fork. Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a copy of a project under your own GitHub account. This lets you make changes without affecting the original repository. Here’s how you can fork a repository on GitHub:\n\nLog In to GitHub:\n\nMake sure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\n\nNavigate to the Repository:\n\nGo to the main page of the repository you want to fork: https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2023\n\nClick the ‘Fork’ Button:\n\nIn the top-right corner of the repository’s page, you’ll find the “Fork” button. Click on it.\n\nChoose an Account:\n\nIf you are a member of any organizations, GitHub will ask you where you’d like to fork the repository. Choose your personal account unless you want to fork it to an organization.\n\nWait for the Forking Process to Complete:\n\nGitHub will then create a copy of the repository in your account. You’ll see an animation indicating the process, and once it’s done, you’ll be redirected to the forked repository under your account.\n\nClone Your Forked Repository:\n\nTo work with the forked repository on your local machine, you can clone it. Navigate to the main page of your forked repo, click on the green “Code” button, copy the URL, and then use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\ngit clone [URL_you_copied]\n\n\nYou can continue to update the forked repository by doing the following:\n\nNavigate to Your Local Repository:\n\nOpen a terminal or command prompt.\nNavigate to the directory where you have your forked repository.\n\nAdd the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote:\n\nUse the following command to add the original repository as an upstream remote:\ngit remote add upstream [URL_of_original_repository]\nFor example, if the original repository’s URL is https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git, the command would be:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git\n\nFetch Changes from the Upstream:\n\nUse the following command to fetch changes from the upstream:\ngit fetch upstream\n\nMerge Changes into Your Local Branch:\n\nFirst, ensure you are on the branch into which you want to merge the upstream changes, typically the main or master branch:\ngit checkout main\nThen, merge the changes from the upstream’s main or master branch:\ngit merge upstream/main\n\nPush Changes to Your Forked Repository on GitHub (if needed):\n\nIf you want these changes to reflect in your GitHub fork, push them:\ngit push origin main\n\n\nNow your fork is synchronized with the original repository. Whenever you want to pull in new changes from the original repository in the future, you just need to repeat steps 3-5.\nTo avoid conflicts you sill want to avoid editing the course notes files and instead make copies."

    "text": "This course introduces UNIX/Linux shell, version control with git and GitHub, R programming, data wrangling with dplyr and data.table, data visualization with ggplot2 and shiny, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio, knitr and markdown. We briefly introduce Monte Carlo simulations, statistical modeling, high-dimensional data techniques, and machine learning and how these are applied to real data. Throughout the course, we use motivating case studies and data analysis problem sets based on challenges similar to those you encounter in scientific research.\nLectures will be mostly live coding. We will go over exercises and challenges together but will pause 1-4 times per lectures so students can complete exercises on their own. The midterm questions will be selected from the exercises presented in class. Some time will be dedicated to answering problem set questions. Lectures will not be recorded.\nStudents are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course.\nProblem sets are mostly composed of open ended questions. Submission should be in the form of a scientific report. Problem set submission need to be completely reproducible. Specifically, students are expected to upload a Quarto document to their GitHub class repository that graders can compile into a readable report."

    "section": "1.3 Computations",
    "text": "1.3 Computations\nThe main reason we use Quarto is because we can include code and execute the code when compiling the document. In R we refer to them as R chunks.\nTo add your own R chunks, you can type the characters above quickly with the key binding command-option-I on the Mac and Ctrl-Alt-I on Windows.\nThis applies to plots as well; the plot will be placed in that position. We can write something like this:\n\nx &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- 2\nx + y\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nBy default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument, which are annotated with |# To avoid showing code in the final document, you can use the argument echo: FALSE. For example:\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe recommend getting into the habit of adding a label to the R code chunks. This will be very useful when debugging, among other situations. You do this by adding a descriptive word like this:\n\nx &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- 2\nx + y\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Academic reports\nQuarto has many nice features that facilitates publishing academic reports in this guide\n\n\n1.3.2 Global excecution options\nIf you want to apply an option globally, you can include in the header, under execute. For example adding the following line to the header make code not show up, by default:\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n\n\n1.3.3 More on markdown\nThere is a lot more you can do with R markdown. We highly recommend you continue learning as you gain more experience writing reports in R. There are many free resources on the internet including:\n\nRStudio’s tutorial: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\nThe knitR book: https://yihui.name/knitr/\nPandoc’s Markdown in-depth documentation"

RStudio provides the Render button that makes it easier to compile the document.\nNote that the first time you click on the Render button, a dialog box may appear asking you to install packages you need. Once you have installed the packages, clicking Render will compile your Quarto file and the resulting document will pop up.\nThis particular example produces an html document which you can see in your working directory. To view it, open a terminal and list the files. You can open the file in a browser and use this to present your analysis. You can also produce a PDF or Microsoft document by changing:\nformat: html to format: pdf or format: docx. We can also produce documents that render on GitHub using format: gfm, which stands for GitHub flavored markdown, a convenient way to share your reports."

For example:\n\ncd ~/docs/resumes\nmv cv.tex ../reports/resume.tex\n\nAnd we can move entire directories. To move the resumes directory into reports, we do as follows:\n\nmv ~/docs/resumes ~/docs/reports/\n\nIt is important to add the last / to make it clear you do not want to rename the resumes directory to reports, but rather move it into the reports directory.\n\n\n2.9.2 cp: copying files\nThe command cp behaves similar to mv except instead of moving, we copy the file, meaning that the original file stays untouched.\n\n\n2.9.3 rm: removing files\nIn point-and-click systems, we remove files by dragging and dropping them into the trash or using a special click on the mouse. In Unix, we use the rm command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnlike throwing files into the trash, rm is permanent. Be careful!\n\n\nThe general way it works is as follows:\n\nrm filename\n\nYou can actually list files as well like this:\n\nrm filename-1 filename-2 filename-3\n\nYou can use full or relative paths. To remove directories, you will have to learn about arguments, which we do later.\n\n\n2.9.4 less: looking at a file\nOften you want to quickly look at the content of a file. If this file is a text file, the quickest way to do is by using the command less. To look a the file cv.tex, you do this:\n\ncd ~/docs/resumes\nless cv.tex \n\nTo exit the viewer, you type q. If the files are long, you can use the arrow keys to move up and down. There are many other keyboard commands you can use within less to, for example, search or jump pages."

You might also need to write R code on a server that does not have RStudio installed. For this reason you need to learn to use a command-line text editors or terminal-based text editors. A key feature of these is that you can do everything you need on a terminal without the need for graphical interface. This is often necessary when using remote servers or computers you are not sitting in front off.\nCertainly! Command-line text editors are essential tools, especially for system administrators, developers, and other users who frequently work in a terminal environment. Here are some of the most popular command-line text editors:\n\nNano - Easy to use and beginner-friendly.\n\nFeatures: Simple interface, easy-to-use command prompts at the bottom of the screen, syntax highlighting.\n\nPico - Originally part of the Pine email client (Pico = PIne COmposer). It’s a simple editor and was widely used before Nano came around.\nVi or Vim - Vi is one of the oldest text editors and comes pre-installed on many UNIX systems. It is harder to use than Nano and Pico but is much more powerful. Vim is an enhanced version of Vi.\nEmacs - Another old and powerful text editor. It’s known for being extremely extensible.\n\nTo use these to edit a file you type, for example,\n\nnano filenmae"

    "text": "2.12 Advanced Unix\n\n2.12.1 Arguments\n\nrm -r directory-name\n\nall files, subdirectories, files in subdirectories, subdirectories in subdirectories, and so on, will be removed. This is equivalent to throwing a folder in the trash, except you can’t recover it. Once you remove it, it is deleted for good. Often, when you are removing directories, you will encounter files that are protected. In such cases, you can use the argument -f which stands for force.\nYou can also combine arguments. For instance, to remove a directory regardless of protected files, you type:\n\nrm -rf directory-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that once you remove there is no going back, so use this command very carefully.\n\n\nA command that is often called with argument is ls. Here are some examples:\n\nls -a \n\n\nls -l \n\nIt is often useful to see files in chronological order. For that we use:\n\nls -t \n\nand to reverse the order of how files are shown you can use:\n\nls -r \n\nWe can combine all these arguments to show more information for all files in reverse chronological order:\n\nls -lart \n\nEach command has a different set of arguments. In the next section, we learn how to find out what they each do.\n\n\n2.12.2 Getting help\n\nman ls\n\nor\n\nls --help\n\n\n\n2.12.3 Pipes\n\nman ls | less\n\nor in Git Bash:\n\nls --help | less \n\nThis is also useful when listing files with many files. We can type:\n\nls -lart | less \n\n\n\n2.12.4 Wild cards\n\nls *.html\n\nTo remove all html files in a directory, we would type:\n\nrm *.html\n\nThe other useful wild card is the ? symbol.\n\nrm file-???.html\n\nThis will only remove files with that format.\nWe can combine wild cards. For example, to remove all files with the name file-001 regardless of suffix, we can type:\n\nrm file-001.* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCombining rm with the * wild card can be dangerous. There are combinations of these commands that will erase your entire filesystem without asking “are you sure?”. Make sure you understand how it works before using this wild card with the rm command.**\n\n\n\n\n2.12.5 Environment variables\nEarlier we saw this:\n\necho $HOME \n\nYou can see them all by typing:\n\nenv\n\nYou can change some of these environment variables. But their names vary across different shells. We describe shells in the next section.\n\n\n2.12.6 Shells\n\necho $SHELL\n\nThe most common one is bash.\nOnce you know the shell, you can change environmental variables. In Bash Shell, we do it using export variable value. To change the path, described in more detail soon, type: (Don’t actually run this command though!)\n\nexport PATH = /usr/bin/\n\n\n\n2.12.7 Executables\n\n\nwhich git\n\nThat directory is probably full of program files. The directory /usr/bin usually holds many program files. If you type:\n\nls /usr/bin\n\nin your terminal, you will see several executable files.\nThere are other directories that usually hold program files. The Application directory in the Mac or Program Files directory in Windows are examples.\nTo see where your system looks:\n\necho $PATH\n\nyou will see a list of directories separated by :. The directory /usr/bin is probably one of the first ones on the list.\nIf your command is called my-ls, you can type:\n\n./my-ls\n\nOnce you have mastered the basics of Unix, you should consider learning to write your own executables as they can help alleviate repetitive work.\n\n\n2.12.8 Permissions and file types\nIf you type:\n\nls -l\n\nAt the beginning, you will see a series of symbols like this -rw-r--r--. This string indicates the type of file: regular file -, directory d, or executable x. This string also indicates the permission of the file: is it readable? writable? executable? Can other users on the system read the file? Can other users on the system edit the file? Can other users execute if the file is executable? This is more advanced than what we cover here, but you can learn much more in a Unix reference book.\n\n\n2.12.9 Commands you should learn\n\ncurl - download data from the internet.\ntar - archive files and subdirectories of a directory into one file.\nssh - connect to another computer.\nfind - search for files by filename in your system.\ngrep - search for patterns in a file.\nawk/sed - These are two very powerful commands that permit you to find specific strings in files and change them.\nln - create a symbolic link. We do not recommend its use, but you should be familiar with it."

This file is now tracked and a copy of this version is kept going forward… this is like adding V1 to your filename.\nYou can commit files directly without using add by explicitely writing the files at the end of the commit:\ngit commit -m \"must add comment\" &lt;filename&gt;\n\n\n\n3.6.5 Push\nTo move to upstream repo we use\ngit push -u origin main\nThe -u flag sets the upstream, so in the future, you can simply use git push to push changes. So going forward we can just type:\ngit push\nHere we need to be careful as if collaborating this will affect the work of others.

For this we use\ngit pull\n\n\n\n3.6.9 Checkout\n If you want to pull down a specific file you from the remote repo you can use:\ngit checkout filename\nBut if you have a newer version in your local repository this will create a conflict. If you are sure you want to get rid of your local copy you can remove and then checkout.\nYou can also use checkout to pull older version:\ngit checkout &lt;commit-id&gt; &lt;filename&gt;\nYou can get the commit-id either on the GitHub webpage or using\ngit log filename\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are asked for passwords when connecting or pushing things to you want to read this and avoid this.

Let’s give them options of places with low murders rates, mountains, and not too small.\n\nShow the subset of murders showing states with less than 1 per 100,000 deaths. Show all variables.\nShow the subset of murders showing states with less than 1 per 100,000 deaths and in the West of the US. Don’t show the region variable.\nShow the largest state with a rate less than 1 per 100,000.\nShow the state with a population of more than 10 million with the lowest rate.\nCompute the rate for each region of the US.\n\nMore practice exercises:\n\nCreate a vector of numbers that starts at 6, does not pass 55, and adds numbers in increments of 4/7: 6, 6 + 4/7, 6 + 8/7, and so on. How many numbers does the list have? Hint: use seq and length.\nMake this data frame:\n\n\ntemp &lt;- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)\ncity &lt;- c(\"Beijing\", \"Lagos\", \"Paris\", \"Rio de Janeiro\", \n          \"San Juan\", \"Toronto\")\ncity_temps &lt;- data.frame(name = city, temperature = temp)\n\nConvert the temperatures to Celsius.\n\nCompute the following sum\n\n\\[\nS_n = 1+1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + \\dots 1/n^2$\n\\]\nShow that as \\(n\\) gets bigger we get closer \\(\\pi^2/6\\).\n\nUse the %in% operator and the predefined object state.abb to create a logical vector that answers the question: which of the following are actual abbreviations: MA, ME, MI, MO, MU?\nExtend the code you used in exercise 7 to report the one entry that is not an actual abbreviation. Hint: use the ! operator, which turns FALSE into TRUE and vice versa, then which to obtain an index."
